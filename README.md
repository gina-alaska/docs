## [docs.gina.alaska.edu](http://docs.gina.alaska.edu)

It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into the static website.  

The content is mostly written by [Geographic Information Network of Alaska (GINA)](http://gina.alaska.edu/) staff:
 * @spruceboy - Jay Cable
 * @dayne - Dayne Broderson
 * Jiang Zhu 

## Getting Started

```
git clone 
cd docs
bundle
# rbenv rehash # if you are using rbenv
```

Now you are ready to hack on content - first launch Jekyll localhost webserver (port 4000 by default) in watch mode so you can just edit and immediately it generates the results when you save.


```
jekyll serve --watch 
```
launch browser to http://localhost:4000

Hack on Content - checkout results
