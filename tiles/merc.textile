h1. Tiles for Web Mercator

GINA publishes a number of datasets suitable for use in mapping frameworks like Google Maps, OpenLayers, or ESRI Rest compatible web mapping frameworks.  These services are provided in a standard "Mercator projection":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection as used by Google and Bing maps.

Here is a list of those tiled datasets:

* "GINA's Best Data Available(BDL)":web_bdl.html
p((.A compilation of various sources to provide the best available imagery base layer for Alaska.
* GINA Extras
** "U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Digital Raster Graphics":http://topomaps.usgs.gov/drg/ Topographic Maps
***Scanned images of USGS standard series topographic maps, including all map collar information.
**** "250k":web_250k_drg.html series
**** "63k":web_63k_drg.html series
**** "25k":web_25k_drg.html series
**** "24k":web_24k_drg.html series
** "Natural Resource Canada Topos":web_nrcan_topo.html
***This service provides access to the Natural Resources Canada 1:250,000 scale topographic covering Canada as a supplement to users working with data near the Alaska-Canada border.
** "All the topographic maps":web_drg.html combined into one tileset
***This service provides access to a single tileset with the best topographic maps, and switches intelligently so the most appropriate map is displayed for the scale requested. It contains the USGS Digital Raster Graphics and the Natural Resources Canada 1:250,000 scale topographic maps series as tiles in an ESRI Rest compatible format.
** "Landsat Pan":web_landsat_pan.html
***This service provides access to a single banded dataset derived from Landsat 7's pan-chromatic band. It was generated from the Landsat 7 datasets provided by "Global Imagery Browse Services Project":https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/GIBS .
** "TerraColor":web_terracolor.html
***This service provides access to a Landsat mosaic generated by the USGS from data acquired from 1988 to 1992 and a simulated true colour Landsat mosaic provide by "Earthstar Geographics, LLC":http://terracolor.net .
** "Shaded Relief NED":web_ned.html
***This service provides access a shaped relief dataset derived from the National Elevation Dataset (NED).
** "GINA Topo/Bathymetry":web_gina_rgb.html or "Black and White":web_gina_bw.html
* "NOAA Nautical Charts":web_noaa_charts.html
* "FAA Charts":web_faa_charts.html
* Additional Data
** "Mat Su LiDAR & Imagery Project":http://www.matsugov.us/it/gis/2011-lidar-imagery-project
***The MatSu LiDAR & Imagery Project is a collection of high-resolution elevation data and aerial imagery for 3680 square miles of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough (MSB) as well as the development of a number of ancillary datasets.
*** "Colored Hillshade":web_matsu_dem.html
*** "Natural Color Imagery":web_matsu_imagery_rgb.html
*** "Near IR Imagery":web_matsu_imagery_nir.html

Examples on how to use the use this data within OpenLayers, Bing Maps, Google Maps version 2, and Google Maps version 3 can be found "here.":http://gisjam.gina.alaska.edu/aksmc2010
