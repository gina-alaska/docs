GINA publishes a number of datasets in a Alaska Albers projection in NAD83, suitable for use in web mapping frameworks like OpenLayers.

The extent for these services is +- 3500000.0 meters, that is to say the bounding box for the root tile in the service is -3500000.0, -3500000.0, 3500000.0, 3500000.0.

Here is a list of those services.
