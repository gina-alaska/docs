h1. Tiles for Web Mercator - MODIS Realtime

This service provides access to MODIS data received at GINA in a natural color presentation.  The data covers main land Alaska. 

Information about the tiles available can be obtained by using a JSON callback function.

The URL for the JSON callback is at "http://realtime.gina.alaska.edu/tiles/modis".  This URL expects the parameter "callback" to be set to the function name to be generated.

For example, "http://realtime.gina.alaska.edu/tiles/modis?callback=function_name" 
would generate a JSON object like:
<code>
	function_name({"scenes":[ ... tiles ... ]});
</code>

Each tile set has an entry in "scenes", and includes the following fields:
* platform
** The platform, normally TERRA 1 or AQUA 1
* size 
** The size of the source dataset
* info
** A short blurb on the tileset in question
* source_url
** Unused.
* kml_url 
** Unused.
* jpeg_url
** The url to a JPG version of the data contained in the tileset, at 250m resolution.
* tile_base_url
** The url to the tile service.  The service expects the tiles X,Y, and Z location to be appended in the form X/Y/Z to this url.
* thumbnail_url
** The url to a small thumbnail sized version of the data contained in the tileset. 
* date
** The date the data was acquired, in UTC.
* id
** GINA's scene id of the source data.  

For example, a single entry in "scenes" would look like this:
<code>
{
	"platform":"TERRA 1",
	"size":60312898,
	"title":"MODIS:20120110.1927.t1.geo",
	"info":"This MODIS image received from the spacecraft TERRA 1 at January 10, 2012 10:27 AM time.",
	"date":"Tue Jan 10 19:27:00 UTC 2012",
	"source_url":null,
	"kml_url":null,
	"id":"20120110.1927.t1.geo",
	"jpeg_url":"http:\/\/dds.gina.alaska.edu\/public\/fire\/imagery_full_color\/2012\/20120110.1927.t1.250m.jpg",
	"tile_base_url":"http:\/\/realtime.gina.alaska.edu\/realtime_tiles\/20120110.1927.t1.geo\/tile\/",
	"thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/dds.gina.alaska.edu\/public\/fire\/imagery_full_color\/2012\/20120110.1927.t1.thumb.jpg"
}
</code>

For this example, the tile at x=9, y=18, z=6 would be accessed at:
<code>
http://realtime.gina.alaska.edu/realtime_tiles/20120110.1927.t1.geo/tile/9/18/6
</code>
