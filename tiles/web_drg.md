Tiles for Web Mercator - Topographic Maps
=========================================

This service provides access to the single tileset with the best topographic maps, and switches intelligently so the most appropriate map is displayed for the scale requested. It contains the [USGS Digital Raster Graphics](http://topomaps.usgs.gov/drg/) and the [Natural Resources Canada](http://www.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/com/index-eng.php) 1:250,000 scale topographic maps series as tiles and in an ESRI Rest compatible format. Use these tiles if you are interested in a single layer with topographic maps for all scales.
