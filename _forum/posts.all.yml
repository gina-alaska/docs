       <p><strong>Welcome beta testers!</strong> We need your feedback to make this a useful service. See the bottom of this message for our contact information.</p>
       
       
       	<p>This post is to announce the release of the Statewide Mapping <span class='caps'>WMS</span> service hosted by <span class='caps'>UAF</span>-GINA. The Statewide Mapping program is a joint effort of the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMVA), and the University of Alaska&#8217;s Geographic Information Network of Alaska (GINA). <span class='caps'>GINA</span> is hosting the imagery service and archive for the program.</p>
       
       
       	<p>This service contains two main datasets.  The first is a natural color presentation of most of <span class='caps'>GINA</span>&#8217;s data holdings with spatial resolutions of less than 15 meters (high resolution satellite and airborne data), with reference layers at larger at larger scales (Landsat and <span class='caps'>MODIS</span> data).  The first service is intended to seamlessly provide users with the best natural color imagery available.   The second dataset is a 15 meter per pixel Landsat panchromatic mosaic of Alaska, which is presented in black and white.</p>
       
       
       	<p>The <span class='caps'>URL</span> for the natural color dataset is <strong>&#8220;http://wms.alaskamapped.org/cgi-bin/bdl.cgi?&#8221;</strong> . <br /><br /></p>

       <p>Well Yes and No.  There is a way to get <span class='caps'>WMS</span> into <span class='caps'>IMS</span> but you can&#8217;t do it with an <span class='caps'>AXL</span> file.</p>
       
       
       	<p>Essentially you tell the browser to get the <span class='caps'>WMS</span> layer and put it behind or on top of the image generated by <span class='caps'>IMS</span>.</p>
       
       
       	<p>You can see an example of this if you pull up the <span class='caps'>AFS</span> Fire site (<a href='http://afsmaps.blm.gov/imf/imf.jsp?site=fire'>http://afsmaps.blm.gov/imf/imf.jsp?site=fire</a>) and open the background folder and 
       check Best Available Image Data.</p>
       
       
       	<p>You will need to zoom in past 1,500,000 and the site will start pulling from <a href='http://wms.alaskamapped.org/cgi-bin/bdl.cgi.'>http://wms.alaskamapped.org/cgi-bin/bdl.cgi.</a>
       I have my own copy of the <span class='caps'>BMNG</span> data so the site doesn&#8217;t need to pull from alaskamapped until zoomed in.</p>
       
       
       	<p>This is not an ideal solution since there is a pause while the image data fills in.  The other possibility is to have the server get the image and then send both images
       at the same time.  This was not possible for me since the site is not allowed to call out.</p>

       To Continue.

       	<li>First, start ArcMap and change the projection to something more Alaska centric, like Alaska Albers.  You can do this by right clicking on &#8220;Layers&#8221;, selecting &#8220;Properties&#8221;, and using the &#8220;Coordinate System&#8221; tab.  We suggest using Alaska Albers, <span class="caps">NAD83</span>. <br>

       		<li>You should now be presented with a world view of the service in Alaska Albers.  ArcMap be default only turns on the first 13 layers, so expand &#8220;Layers&#8221; and adjust which layers you want to use.  We suggest using the &#8220;MODIS_Natural_Color&#8221; layer set for <span class="caps">MODIS</span> imagery, and any of the first 15 <span class="caps">AVHRR</span> imagery layers from either the <span class="caps">AVHRR</span>_Natural_Color, or <span class="caps">AVHRR</span>_Natural_Color_night layer groups. <br /><img src="http://wms.alaskamapped.org/help/arcmap_realtime_examples/wms_realtime_instructions_%237.png"></li>

       	</ol>
       
       
       Things to keep in mind while using the service:
       	<ul>
       	<li>The layers in the service are updated as new data comes in, thus older layers can be removed while you are using them.  We suggest not using the last couple of <span class="caps">AVHRR</span> and <span class="caps">MODIS</span> layers, as these will be removed first.  </li>
       		<li>Don&#8217;t turn all the layers on!  There are on average, over 200 <span class="caps">AVHRR</span> images in the service.  If all the layers are turned on, it will be quite slow.</li>
       	</ul>
       
       
       	<p>If you have any problems with the service, additional questions as to how to use it, or suggestions as to how to make it more useful please let us know.  We would really like the service to be useful and feedback is an essential part of this.</p>

       	<ol>
       	<li>The high res data should turn on as soon as possible (very small scales), so the users know that high res data is available</li>
       		<li>The high res data should turn on the scale is such that the data is &#8220;useful&#8221;, ie you can identify features.</li>

If you decide to use it, please give us some feedback as to how well it works for you.

       This post provides a quick overview of the data provided by SDMI via WMS.   Please let us know if you have any suggestions as how to make the services more useful. 
       
       *Best Data Available Service*
       
       This is the main service, which attempts to provide a seemless dataset composed of the best available natural colour data covering Alaska.   It is composed of three layer groups "bdl_low_res", "bdl_mid_res", "bdl_high_res". The layers are intended to be used in the Alaska Albers, NAD83 projection, but could be used in other projections without major problems.   Please keep in mind that other projections will be slower, and might not render well in all cases.
       
       The url for this service is "http://wms.alaskamapped.org/bdl?".  Here is a link to the "capabilities document":http://wms.alaskamapped.org/bdl.cgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetCapabilities .
       
        * The *bdl_low_res* layer contains the Blue Marble Next Generation July dataset (http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/features/blue_marble.html).  It is intended to be viewed at scales greater than 250m per pixel

        * The *bdl_mid_res* layer contains a Landsat mosaic generated by the USGS from data acquired from 1988 to 1992 and a simulated true colour Landsat mosaic provide by Earthstar Geographics LLC. It is intended to be viewed at scales greater than 15m per pixel.  Imagery copyright Earthstar Geographics (http://www.terracolor.net).

       *Extras Sevice*
       
       The BDL Extras service is a "grab bag" of raster layers and houses the layers that do not have a logical place within the main BDL service.  The layers are, for the most part, stored in Alaska Albers, NAD83, but could be used in other projections without major problems.   Please keep in mind that other projections will be slower, and might not render well in all cases.

       *Layers*
         
       *  DRG 
       This group provides four layers, "drg_24k", "drg_25k", "drg_63k", "drg_250k", which contain the USGS topographic maps for the scales 1:24,000, 1:25,000, 1:63,360, and 1:250,000 respectively.

       <p>Editing Open Street Map is a new favorite hobby (obsession) of mine.  The public domain imagery hosted by <span class="caps">GINA</span> is an awesome resource to use for correcting and improving <span class="caps">OSM</span>.  You can either use the <span class="caps">WMS</span> service in the <span class="caps">JOSM</span> editor, or the tile services in the potlatch editor.  The Potlatch editor is browser based, much simpler, and my preferred environment.  In order to have the imagery appear when editing, you need to click on the set options button in the editing tab, set the custom background to <code>http: //tile_server/!/!/!.jpg</code> (or <code>.png</code>)  where  tile_server is some host providing tiles in the Spherical Mercator projection.  The <code>!</code>s will be replaced by potlatch when requesting tiles with the <strong>z,y,x</strong> values, in that order, of the tiles needed.  See <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/overlays.html#Tile_Overlays">http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/...</a> for more info on the google tiling scheme <span class="caps">OSM</span> expects.</p>
       
       
       	<p>The tiles at <code>http: //swmha.gina.alaska.edu/tilesrv/bdl/tile/!/!/!.jpg</code> fit the bill, except they are in <strong>x,y,z</strong> order.</p>
       
       
       	<p>The following very simple python script runs in the background on my computer and redirects the url <code>http: //localhost:8081 /!/!/!.jpg</code> to the correct tiles at <span class="caps">GINA</span>.  It works great for me, and will allow me to keep mapping during the winter.  Hopefully someone at <span class="caps">GINA</span> can implement something more robust to do server side re-direction (if they haven&#8217;t already), making it simpler to use the tiles in <span class="caps">OSM</span>.</p>

       We now AVHRR NDVI composites available via WCS.  The data starts in spring of 1990 and runs though the fall of 2009.  Before using the data be sure to check out the "dataset's documentation":http://ivm.cr.usgs.gov/Metadata.doc which explains how the data is scaled along with other important information.
       
       The urls for the services are based on a scheme like: "http://ndvi.gina.alaska.edu/_year_/avhrr" were year is replaced by the year that is desired. 
       
       For example, the url for avhrr ndvi data for the year 2009 would be http://ndvi.gina.alaska.edu/2009/avhrr.
       
       The data is available as biweekly and weekly composites, with the layer names telling the duration of the composite as well as the start and end date.  For example, the layer "AK2009_07day244250" is a weekly composite and started on Julian Day 244 and ended on Julian Day 250.
       
       Each layer contains 14 bands.  Here is a quick overview of the data, but please refer to the "documentation":http://ivm.cr.usgs.gov/Metadata.doc for more details.
