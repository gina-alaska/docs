We are working on creating a ArcGIS Layer file utilizing the BDL WMS feed and noticed that the 15 - 30m Landsat Alaska Overview turns on after the high resolution coverages. Can you set the scale dependency's so that the Landsat imagery is on before the high resolution images?  Thanks!

Never mind, the scales are fine, it appears ArcMap is not pulling in the WMS feeds efficiently for the Landsat layer resulting in sporadic display.

AICC ArcIMS site has no issues must be the overbearing overhead of ArcGIS....

We can adjust the scales at which things turn on if need, so let us know if you think they should be different.

There seems to be three thoughts on when the high res data (or more when layers turn on in general) turn on:
# The high res data should turn on as soon as possible (very small scales), so the users know that high res data is available
# The high res data should turn on the scale is such that the data is "useful", ie you can identify features.
# All layers should be visible at all times, and its the user's responsibility to turn on only the layers that are needed.

Its possible that we should setup 3 different services with each assumption - please let us know if this would be useful.
