# First, start ArcMap and change the projection to something more Alaska centric, like Alaska Albers.  You can do this by right clicking on "Layers", selecting "Properties", and using the "Coordinate System" tab.  We suggest using Alaska Albers, NAD83. <br>

# Next, right click on "Layers", and select "Add Data": <br>

# Fill out the "URL" field with "http://gas.gina.alaska.edu/wms_feed/wms.cgi?" :

# There should now be a "Realtime_WMS_Feed on gas.gina.alaska.edu" option under GIS Servers.  Select it.:

# You should now be presented with a world view of the service in Alaska Albers.  ArcMap be default only turns on the first 13 layers, so expand "Layers" and adjust which layers you want to use.  We suggest using the "MODIS_Natural_Color" layer set for MODIS imagery, and any of the first 15 AVHRR imagery layers from either the AVHRR_Natural_Color, or AVHRR_Natural_Color_night layer groups.

Things to keep in mind while using the service:
* The layers in the service are updated as new data comes in, thus older layers can be removed while you are using them.  We suggest not using the last couple of AVHRR and MODIS layers, as these will be removed first.  
* Don't turn all the layers on!  There are on average, over 200 AVHRR images in the service.  If all the layers are turned on, it will be quite slow.  


If you have any problems with the service, additional questions as to how to use it, or suggestions as to how to make it more useful please let us know.  We would really like the service to be useful and feedback is an essential part of this.
