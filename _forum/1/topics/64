We have a basic WCS service up with the section of the "National Elevation Database (NED)":http://ned.usgs.gov/ that covers the state of Alaska.  It is available in 2 arc second and 1/3 arc second forms, with the 1/3 arc second data covering only the north slope.  

We would appreciate any feedback folks have about using it.

The url for the service is *"http://wms.alaskamapped.org/cgi-bin/wcs_test.cgi?"*

If you have any issues with the service, questions, or suggestions, please email us at wms@alaskamapped.org or post in this forum.  Feedback is very important - we can not do anything about problems we do not know about. 

Here are some basic instructions on using our test WCS with ESRI's ArcMap 9.3.

1: Fire up Arcmap and set the data frame to use a useful projection like Alaska Albers, NAD83.  The data is stored in Alaska Albers, NAD 83.
2: Add the WCS service by right clicking on "Layers", selecting "Add WCS Server", and entering "http://wms.alaskamapped.org/cgi-bin/wcs_test.cgi?" in the "URL" box.

3: Next select the WCS service in the "Add Data" dialog.
4: Next select which dataset you would like to add: the "NED_2_ARC_SEC" or the "NED_ONE_THIRD_ARC_SEC" datasets.

5: The data you selected should now appear in ArcMap.  It is probibly all black or blank at this point.  Don't panic - ArcMap defaults to strange minimum and maximum values.  Right click on the dataset in the Layers sidebar, and set the "Min" and "Max" values to something reasonable.

We have layer files available that make it much easier to add to your ArcMap.  "WCS layer files":http://www.alaskamapped.org/public_docs/layers/

Let us know if they do not work for you or any other issues you see.  So far the feed back (Parker Martyn) has been postive for the WCS services.  Feedback via forum or email is very welcome.
