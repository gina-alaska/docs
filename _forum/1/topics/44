The BDL coverage of the Barrow triangle is very choppy with various image sources pieced together.  Are there plans to ingest better imagery for this area?  There is some beautiful 2002 Quickbird imagery which covers the Barrow triangle.  It was purchased under an NSF license.  Would you consider uplifting the license for this area?  See:  http://nsidc.org/data/arcss304.html

NunaTech,

Thanks for bringing this to our attention.  I took a look through our 'to-be-ingested' pile and didn't find any interesting data for Barrow area.  We've tossed this request up the SDMI ladder and we are now looking into the license uplift cost for this data.

Just a quick update.   Things are moving forward on finding out how much a license uplift on this data would cost.   We have tracked down some of the magic information needed to get a quote for uplift from Digital Globe on this data and that has been sent off.  Also looking for partners to cost share the uplift costs.  

I'll let you know once things progress further.

Over 3000 digital stills taken between 7 and 10 August 2006 by aerial photographic
survey from Nulavik (about ~60 km southwest of Barrow) to the U.S./Canadian border, along with a GIS shapefile
that allows the photos to be viewed interactively with mapping software,
have been published as <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/436/">USGS Data Series 436</a>.
This project was part of the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geology Program's
National Assessment of Shorline Change and was supported by BASC.

Is there any news on the potential license uplift for the 2002 Barrow Quickbird imagery?  -Allison
