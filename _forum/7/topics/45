With all the KML layers being made the last few weeks we decided a single point of entry for finding/hosting KML files was needed at GINA.  Enter in <a href="http://kml.gina.alaska.edu">kml.gina.alaska.edu</a>.  Nothing fancy but it does provide an easy way to get your hands on one of the KML feeds from GINA.
