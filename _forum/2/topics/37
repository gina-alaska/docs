Appologies to the users of this forum.  Turns out I broke it a few weeks ago and didn't notice.  It was only broken for new posts (browsing the forum worked fine).

Thanks to our new GINA staff ninja, Will, for fixing it up.

Wow, it was broke even more than I had originally thought.  New users were unable to sign up.  This has been corrected now.  If you notice any issues with this form please toss me an email (dayne@gina.alaska.edu) and let me know.
