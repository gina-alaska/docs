SDMI Inventory WFS
==================

We are providing a [Web Feature Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service) that allows access to information about the data available though SDMIâ€™s WMS and for download via the [SDMI Browse Site](http://browse.alaskamapped.org) . The URL for the service is http://wfs.alaskamapped.org/inventory . More information on how to use the service can be found in our [WMS and WFS tutorial](http://www.alaskamapped.org/public_docs/arcgis_wms_tutorial.pdf), available at: <http://www.alaskamapped.org/public_docs/arcgis_wms_tutorial.pdf> .

Please contact us if you encounter problems, have questions, or suggestions.
