GINA publishes a number of raster datasets via the "Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)":http://www.opengeospatial.org/ "Web Mapping Service(WMS)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service . These WMS are usable in a wide array of desktop mapping tools such as ArcMap or QGIS.

For a pictorial guide to the data available via WMS, please see the "SDMI gallery page.":http://www.alaskamapped.org/data/gallery 

Here is a list of various services available:
* "Best Data Available(BDL) WMS":bdl.html
* "Extras":extras.html
* "FAA Charts":faa.html
* "NOAA Charts":noaa.html
* "Realtime MODIS":modis.html
* "Alaska Energy Authority Susitna-Watana Hydro Project":http://gis.suhydro.org

We also have some documentation on how to use our WMS services.
