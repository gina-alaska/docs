AutoCAD OGC notes
=================

Getting your OGC services into AutoCAD has historically been very problematic. We at GINA do not have AutoCAD to do our own in-house testing and rely on our users to give us feedback on what recipies work correctly for the various AutoCAD applications and versions out there. Feel free to send us notes of success, failure, or fixed-it notes.
