OGC Services
============

GINA publishes quite a number of datasets via [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/) services.

-   [Raster datasets via Web Mapping Services (WMS)](wms/)
-   [Gridded datasets via Web Coverage Services (WCS)](wcs/)
-   [Vector datasets via Web Feature Services (WFS)](wfs/)

For ESRI users we have some [general notes on using the OGC services with ESRI toolsets.](esri_ogc.html)
