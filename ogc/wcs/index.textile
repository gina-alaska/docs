h1. Web Coverage Services

GINA publishes several gridded datasets via "Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)":http://www.opengeospatial.org/ "Web Coverage Services(WCS)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Coverage_Service .  

* "Digital Elevation Map (DEM) datasets":dem.html
* "NDVI data":/ndvi

A very basic tutorial on how to load these services in ArcMap can be found "here:":arcgis_wcs.html
